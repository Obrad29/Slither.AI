# Slither.AI
Slither.io bot (AI) written in Javascript.

The objective of this proyect is to learn some Javascript and develop an AI inside a human driven game.

In this first version the code is not fully documented because of it may change. Also I'm not optimizing it (because of the same reason).

## Installation

You need an extension for your web browser to execute user scripts.

I use Tampermonkey for Chrome.
